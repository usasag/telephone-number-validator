# US Telephone Number Validator

This is a simple web application that validates US telephone numbers. It's a project for the freeCodeCamp certification.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the web page. The CSS includes a custom font from Google Fonts and custom CSS variables for colors.
- JavaScript: Used for handling user interactions and validating the phone numbers.

## How It Works

The user enters a phone number into the input field and clicks the "Validate" button. The application then checks if the phone number matches the US phone number format. If it does, it displays a message saying the phone number is valid. If it doesn't, it displays a message saying the phone number is invalid. The user can also clear the input field and the result message by clicking the "Clear" button.
